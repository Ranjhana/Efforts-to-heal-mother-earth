# Efforts-to-heal-mother-earth
I have noticed that human have strange habit i.e. they blindly follow. As the water always flow from higher altitude to lower altitude. Same way human always looks for this ease life and ends up making problems for others. 
Environment getting hurt by human's actions and we are least bother about. So if we start something which could help in saving environment. It will be really good. lets direct human in this direction, one or two starts then definitely 100 will follow. 

Idea
    The idea is if we see things, we react. 
    Same if we start a shop where shop is full of plants, Gamla, seeds etc. 
    Definitely shop with various flowers and plant will look beautiful and human can't resist good look. Human is always attracted by         beautiful things.
    
 Products:
  1. Gamla
  2. Plants
  3. Seeds
  
  Attention:
  
  Summer will show and gonna make human feel heat. He realises important of trees. 
  Golden time to start "Baby step to save mother Earth"
